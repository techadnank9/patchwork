# Guild Integrations

Connect external APIs to Guild agents. Integrations are defined by an OpenAPI spec, managed entirely through the CLI, and require no code deployment — tools are generated automatically.

## When to Use This

Activate when user:

- Mentions `guild integration` commands
- Wants to connect an external API to agents
- Has an OpenAPI spec they want to use
- Asks about building custom service tools
- Mentions integration versions, operations, or publishing
- Wants to configure auth (API key or OAuth) for an integration

## Lifecycle Overview

```
Create integration (creates a draft version) → Add operations → Build → Publish → Connect → Use in agent
```

Each step is a CLI command. The integration exists in Guild's backend — no local files or npm packages to manage.

## CLI Commands

### Create an Integration

```bash
guild integration create <name> \
  --description "What this integration does" \
  --base-url "https://api.example.com" \
  --auth-scheme api-key \
  --header-template "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

**Auth schemes (pick one):**

**API Key** (simpler, most common):

```bash
guild integration create my-service \
  --auth-scheme api-key \
  --header-template "X-API-Key: {token}"
```

The `{token}` placeholder is replaced with the user's stored credential at runtime. Common header templates:

- `Authorization: Bearer {token}` — Bearer token
- `X-API-Key: {token}` — Custom header
- `Authorization: Token {token}` — Token prefix

**OAuth 2.0:**

```bash
guild integration create my-service \
  --auth-scheme oauth \
  --install-url "https://provider.com/oauth/authorize" \
  --token-url "https://provider.com/oauth/token" \
  --client-id "your-client-id" \
  --client-secret "your-client-secret" \
  --scopes "read,write"
```

**Other options:**

- `--owner <org-id>` — Assign to an organization (default: your user account)
- `--public` — Make visible to all users

`create` also creates a draft version and prints its ID. Add operations to that draft directly — there is no need to create a version first.

### Create a Version

```bash
guild integration version create <integration-id-or-name>
```

Creates an additional draft version, for the second and later versions of an integration. Running it straight after `create` leaves you with two empty drafts. All operation changes happen on a draft before building.

### Add Operations from OpenAPI

```bash
guild integration operation create <integration-id-or-name> \
  --openapi spec.yaml
```

The OpenAPI spec defines what API endpoints become available as agent tools. Each operation in the spec becomes one tool.

Operations land in the most recently created version. Pass `--version-number <semver>` to target a specific version instead.

### Build a Version

```bash
guild integration version build <integration-id-or-name> \
  --version-number 1.0.0
```

Assigns a semver version number and triggers validation. The CLI polls until validation completes. Exit code 0 means passed, 1 means failed.

Use `--no-wait` to return immediately without polling.

### Publish a Version

```bash
guild integration version publish <integration-id-or-name> \
  --version-number 1.0.0
```

Makes the version available to agents. Only versions that passed validation can be published.

### Connect Credentials

```bash
guild integration connect <integration-id-or-name> \
  --owner <account>
```

Configures credentials (API key or OAuth tokens) so agents can make authenticated requests. `--owner` is required and names the account that owns the credential — a username, an org name, or an account ID. Pass `--token <value>` to supply an API key non-interactively.

### Test a Version

```bash
guild integration version test <integration-id-or-name> \
  --version-number 1.0.0 \
  --operation list_users
```

`--operation` is required. Omit `--version-number` to test the most recently created version.

### List and Inspect

```bash
guild integration list                           # List all integrations
guild integration get <id-or-name>               # Get integration details
guild integration version list <id-or-name>      # List versions
guild integration operation list <id-or-name>    # List operations (tools)
guild integration operation list <id-or-name> --json  # Full schemas in JSON
```

## OpenAPI Spec Requirements

The parser accepts OpenAPI 3.0 YAML specs. Each qualifying HTTP operation becomes a tool.

### Supported HTTP Methods

GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

### What Gets Extracted

For each operation:

| OpenAPI field                       | Maps to                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `operationId`                       | Tool name (snake_case)           |
| `summary`                           | Tool description (max 255 chars) |
| Path parameters                     | `input_path_type` schema         |
| Query parameters                    | `input_query_type` schema        |
| Request body (`application/json`)   | `input_body_type` schema         |
| Response body (200/201/204/default) | `output_body_type` schema        |
| `components/schemas`                | Reusable type references         |

### What Gets Skipped

- Operations without `application/json` request body (if body is required)
- Operations without a parseable response schema
- Non-JSON content types (file uploads, XML, etc.)

### Best Practices

- Always set `operationId` — otherwise one is synthesized from method+path
- Define response schemas in `components/schemas` and reference with `$ref` — bare `type: object` produces untyped output
- Keep `summary` under 255 characters
- Use `description` for longer explanations

### Example Spec

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Acme API
  version: 1.0.0
servers:
  - url: https://api.acme.com/v1

paths:
  /tickets:
    get:
      operationId: list_tickets
      summary: List all tickets
      parameters:
        - name: status
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
            enum: [open, closed, pending]
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/TicketListResponse'

  /tickets/{ticket_id}:
    get:
      operationId: get_ticket
      summary: Get a ticket by ID
      parameters:
        - name: ticket_id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ticket'

components:
  schemas:
    Ticket:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        subject:
          type: string
        status:
          type: string
          enum: [open, closed, pending]
    TicketListResponse:
      type: object
      properties:
        tickets:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Ticket'
        total:
          type: integer
```

## Using Integrations in an Agent

After publishing, the integration's tools are available as an npm package:

```typescript
import { AcmeTools } from '@guildai-services/owner~acme';
```

Where `owner` is the integration owner's username or org, and `acme` is the integration name.

> Skills are different from integrations. A skill such as `acme~brand-voice` does not produce a package like `@guildai-services/acme~brand-voice`. To let an agent use skills, import `skillsTools` from `@guildai/agents-sdk` once. Keep skills knowledge-only; if the behavior needs API access, executable code, credentials, or a dedicated tool set, build an integration or agent instead.

### Selecting Specific Tools

Use `pick()` to select only the tools your agent needs:

```typescript
import { pick } from '@guildai/agents-sdk';
import { AcmeTools } from '@guildai-services/owner~acme';

const tools = pick(AcmeTools, ['acme_list_tickets', 'acme_get_ticket']);
```

Tool names follow the pattern `{integration}_{operation_id}`.

### Requesting Credentials

Agents request credentials at runtime via the SDK. The runtime injects stored credentials server-side — agents never see raw API keys or tokens.

### Agent package.json

Add the integration as a dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@guildai-services/owner~acme": "*"
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Mark operations as webhook-triggered by adding `x-guild-hook: true` in the OpenAPI spec:

```yaml
paths:
  /tickets/webhook:
    post:
      operationId: receive_ticket_event
      x-guild-hook: true
      summary: Receive ticket webhook events
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/TicketEvent'
      responses:
        '200':
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
```

Webhook operations deliver responses asynchronously via callback instead of synchronous HTTP response.

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Failed

After `guild integration version build`, check the validation status:

```bash
guild integration version get <id-or-name> --version-number 1.0.0 --json
```

Common causes:

- Invalid OpenAPI spec syntax
- Missing required schema references (`$ref` pointing to undefined schemas)
- Operations with no parseable request/response content types

### Operations Not Appearing

Run `guild integration operation list <id-or-name> --json` to see what was parsed. Endpoints are skipped when:

- No `application/json` content type is available
- Response schema can't be extracted
- The operation has no `operationId` and path synthesis failed

### Auth Failures at Runtime

- **API Key:** Verify `guild integration connect --owner <account>` was run and the token is valid
- **OAuth:** Check that `install_url`, `token_url`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` are correct
- Re-run `guild integration connect --owner <account>` to refresh credentials

### Package Not Found in Agent

- Verify the version is published: `guild integration version list <id-or-name>`
- Check the import path matches: `@guildai-services/{owner}~{name}`
- Ensure the agent's `package.json` includes the dependency
